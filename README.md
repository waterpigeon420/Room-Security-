# Room-Security-
ROOM AUTOMATION AND SECURITY USING ARDUINO, TWITTER, AND RASPBERRY PI
- Used Arduino with Bluetooth and IR sensor to capture all IR based devices remote signals within the room.
- Used a raspberry pi to implement a face recognition computer vision model using OpenCV2 to build biometric
security for the room.
- Used a twitter web scraper along with a raspberry pi to send commands to the Arduino to remotely control the
room through tweets.

The project involved controlling IR based devices such as the Television, Air conditioner and lights. An arduino with a IR transmitter and bluetooth reciever was used to control these devices, it was all computationally actuated by a Raspberry Pi that operated only when the user's face was detected.
